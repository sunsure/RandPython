RPy
======================
RPy is a very simple, yet robust, Python interface to the R Programming Language.	 
It can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary R functions (including the graphic functions).	
All errors from the R language are converted to Python exceptions.	 
Any module installed for the R system can be used from within Python.

Two flavours are available: **rpy** and **rpy2**.
